**TLDR**; I made a visual timeline of my career (CV) completely in R. Here I will show how it was done, and in the process how to hack `ggplot` objects, add images to plots, and use pretty much any font in your ggplots.

This is the final result, and if you are interested on how it was generated, so read along.

## Motivation

Recently I give a presentation with an overview of my career, with a focus on data analysis / bioinformatics. As my path to data analysis has not been straightforward, I wanted walk the audience through my career as we went along the several stages. Because I am someone who generally takes pride on my presentations, and this was about me after all, and I wanted something:

- Clean and elegant design
- Rich in features
- Playful
- With a wind a nod to data analysis and visualization

Basically me in a plot.

On top of that, I wanted to showcase my coding skills, so whatever I presented it had to be done 100% with code. No post-production in Inkscape, and in keeping with this mantra, the slide-deck itself was done with `LaTeX`.  

Because the plot is so intrinsically linked with the presentation itself, I will also explain my though process on certain choices and how that is linked with the presentation[^1].

## Framework

Important for me, due to to way my career as paned out so far,and the goal of the presentation was to [^2]:

- depict my journey from wet lab to data analysis, with increasing amounts of time spent analysis data.
- the rough dates should be present
- include milestones such as academic publications and degrees
- show how international the path has been

Initially I thought of using a Gantt chart as those are the got to plot for timelines and there are several packages for this [^3]. However, after prototyping with pen and paper, I decided it would be too hard to incorporate all the features I wanted to have without cluttering the plot. Basically, it didn't feel right.

Luckily inspiration was in one of my favorite [blogs](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/) by an excellent data scientist and communicator, which just happened to have a similar path to data science as my own. Her visual CV is [hand drawn](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/page/about/), and looks great, but I made it a challenge to re-create that playfulness, along with the richness of information (also I am terrible at drawing/painting).

## Set-up

First set is to load the libraries:

- `tidyverse`, for general data wrangling
- `lubridate`, fancy functions to work with dates
- `data.table`, rolling joins and general awesomeness
- `ggplot2`, plots et al.
- `ggthemes`, I don't think this was actually used.
- `scales`, functions to add some spice to ggplot axis
- `cowplot`, to add images to plots
- `extrafont`, use of system fonts

```{r libraries, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
library("ggthemes")
library("cowplot")
library("extrafont")
extrafont::loadfonts(quiet = TRUE)
library("bib2df")
library("rcrossref")
```


## My CV in a table

The data itself is structured in a straightforward way with variables for my roles, dates, location, and a mock data analysis ratio (how much data analysis was part of my role). Because this is supposed to a cartoonish overview of my CV, not a rigorous representation, the data analysis ratio is close to reality but I won't swear it is strictly correct.

```{r input-data}
antonio <- fread("/home/adomingu/Documents/personal/CV/visual_cv/timeline_cv.tsv") %>%
  melt(measure.vars = c("Start", "End"), variable.name = "Timpepoint", value.name = "Date") %>%
  .[, Date := as.IDate(Date)]

antonio %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


## The Canvas

With the events of my CV in tabular format I could get started with plotting. Key features of the plot:

1. A theme with as few visual elements as possible, and attention to detail
2. The font carefully selected (luckily I have dozens of fonts installed in my system)
3. Addition of small pictograms

The first and second items were achieved with a custom theme and the package `extrafont`. `extrafont` allows us to use pretty much any system font in out R plots. There a couple of steps that need to be done before system font can be used:

- The first is `extrafont::font_import()` to detect and import system fonts. This needs to be done only once after installing the package, or any time a new font installed. This can take several minutes depending on how many system fonts your system has. Mine has a LOT.
- The second step is to load the system fonts in the current `R` session to make them available, `extrafont::loadfonts(quiet = TRUE)` 

```{r extrafont, eval = FALSE}
extrafont::font_import()
extrafont::loadfonts(quiet = TRUE)

fonttable() %>%
  filter(stringr::str_detect(FullName, "Annie"))  
```

You can also also the third snippet of code make sure the desired font is indeed available in `R`.

```{r gg-themes}
theme_set(theme_light())
theme_update(
    text = element_text(family = "Annie Use Your Telescope", size = 12),
    legend.title=element_text(size=6), 
    legend.text=element_text(size=6),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    axis.line.x = element_line(size = 1, linetype = "solid", arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "inches"), type = "closed")),
    panel.grid = element_line(colour = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "gray", linetype = "dotted", size = 0.5),
    panel.border = element_blank()
  )
```

With that I could produce the first, and very basic, plot:

```{r base-plot, fig.show="asis"}
p <- ggplot(antonio, aes(x = Date, y = da_ratio)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "black", size = 1.5, span = 1, se = FALSE) +
  xlim(min(antonio$Date), as.IDate("2020-12-01")) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "#c72e29", size = 1) +
  annotate(
    geom = "text", x = min(antonio$Date) %m+% months(6), y = 0.35, label = "Wet lab",
    color = "red", size = 5, family = "Annie Use Your Telescope"
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "text", x = as.IDate("2012-12-01"), y = 0.9, label = "Data analysis",
    color = "red", size = 5, family = "Annie Use Your Telescope"
  ) 

p
```

The data science trajectory line is a smooth line result of linear model fitted to the time points in the CV. The model was chosen based on the very accurate statistical measure that the fit needed be visually appealing - smooth and in an upward trajectory after a particular time point. 

To add the small icons, I ended up `magick` which I could only install with conda (well, [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)), due to missing dependencies. I did try the R way with `install.packages("magick")` but gave up after the second error. Life is too short. 

The icons themselves were downloaded from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) which has tons of free to use icons (with attribution). I ended up paying for these because I liked them so much, but I will credit the author, [Tippawan Sookruay](https://thenounproject.com/wanny4/), nevertheless.

As these images will be included in several versions of the plot, I wrapped the code in a function to save typing:


```{r add-images}
add_img <- function(gg){
  ggdraw(gg) +
  draw_image("/home/adomingu/Documents/personal/CV/visual_cv/figure/noun_pipette_3384602.svg.png", scale = 0.1, x = 0.09, y = 0.001, hjust = 0.52, vjust = 0.25) +
  draw_image("/home/adomingu/Documents/personal/CV/visual_cv/figure/noun_chart_3384933.svg.png", scale = 0.1, x = 0.4, y = 0.25)
}

p_save <- add_img(p)

# ggsave("../assets/img/timeline_final.pdf", dpi = 600, width = 10, height = 6, units = "cm")
ggsave("../assets/img/timeline_icons.png", p_save, dpi = 600, width = 10, height = 6, units = "cm")

```

![Timeline with icons](../assets/img/timeline_icons.png?w=300)


So now we have the basics:

- A timeline on the x-axis
- rough % of data analysis as part of my job
- and a few icons to show how it started and it is going

In technical terms, the most difficult part was to add the icons, and in particular placing them in the right location. Not only did it take a lot of trial an error, it was only just right once saved as a file (pdf). I wanted to have a wide plot to fit with the slides, and the plotting window is square, so some eye-balling was required. I tried a few option in terms of packages (patchwork for example), but in the end `magick` was the best one for my purposes.

But we are not done yet: career milestones and cities I lived are still missing.


## Publications

Until now I have worked in fairly academic milieu where one's achievements are measured mostly by publications. whilst I don't particularly agree with this[^4], it is a decent proxy for output which is what I was looking to represent. Other fields will have their own metrics of productivity (number of sales, features shipped, etc).

For full reproducibility, I tried to get my publications list from pubmed or ORCID but ran into problems. The issue with pubmed queries is that my name follows Portuguese naming conventions, and each publishers seems to ignore what I write in the provided forms and just makes up a different version of my name. Not helping matters is that my first and last name are fairly common, so there were a lot of false positives in the pubmed queries. In ORCID some of the variables I needed, namely the publication date, were missing for some papers.   

I do keep all my publications in a `bibtex` file exported from zotero, so that in end was the route I took. The publication data was extracted with the help of `bib2df` to read in the bibtex file, and `rcrossref` to retrieve publications dates which were incomplete or missing in the bibtex file.

```{r add-publications}
# ==========================================================================
# Get publication list
# ==========================================================================
path <- "/home/adomingu/Documents/personal/CV/Awesome-CV/examples/resume/AD_papers.bib"

df <- bib2df(path)
setDT(df)
my_dois <- df[!is.na(DOI)]$DOI

# my_dois <- rorcid::identifiers(rorcid::works("0000-0002-1803-1863"))
pubs <- rcrossref::cr_works(dois = my_dois)$data %>%
  setDT() %>%
  .[, c("title", "type", "container.title", "published.print", "published.online", "deposited")] %>%
  .[, Date := ifelse(!is.na(published.print), published.print, published.online)] %>%
  .[, Date := ifelse(!is.na(Date), Date, deposited)] %>%
  .[, Date := ifelse(nchar(Date) == 4, paste(Date, "03-01", sep = "-"), Date)] %>%
  .[, Date := ifelse(nchar(Date) == 7, paste(Date, "01", sep = "-"), Date)] %>%
  .[, Date := as.IDate(Date)]

pubs %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Once that was done, I could proceed to add the publications has milestones in the plot - one point per paper.

Not so fast.

Turns out that when that smooth line was created, a linear model fit on the original time points, I lost the reference points, ratio of data analysis, of the y-axis. So now I also need to estimate the Y positions in this plot.


## ggplot hacking

I have done enough custom plots, and spent enough hours googling on how to do it, that I know that `ggplot` objects store a ton of information which can be accessed and modified (at you own risk). So what I did was to extract the `x` and `y` coordinates of the fitted line from the `ggplot` object.

This was done in several steps:

- re-run the linear model (`spline`)
- plot the fitted line
- extract the coordinates from the plot (`ggplot_build(p_smooth)$data[[1]]`)

```{r fake-trajectory}
#
# Retrieve the smooth line (dummy timeline) to add points of interest
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
spline_int <- as.data.frame(spline(antonio$Date, antonio$da_ratio))

p_smooth <- ggplot(antonio, aes(x = Date, y = da_ratio)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "black", size = 1.5, span = 1, se = FALSE) +
  xlim(min(antonio$Date), as.IDate("2020-12-01")) +
  ylim(0, 1)

smooth_df <- ggplot_build(p_smooth)$data[[1]] %>% 
  setDT() %>%
  .[, Date := as.IDate(x)] %>%
  .[]

smooth_df %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Now I have the timeline coordinates, but these need to be matched with the dates of the publication. The x-axis values (dates) of the fitted plot are intervals which do not match the CV dates. To solve that problem, as nearly any data manipulation problem, `data.table` and rolling joins came to the rescue. The goal was to the closest time point of my CV dates in the fitted plot. 

```{r adjust-milestone-dates}

## find the closest date of publications in the dummy timeline
pubs_smooth <- smooth_df[pubs, roll = "nearest", on = "Date"] %>%
  .[, new_date := as.IDate(x)] %>%
  .[, Date:= NULL] %>%
  setnames("new_date", "Date") %>%
  .[, c("Date", "y", "title")] %>%
  .[Date <= as.IDate("2012-01-01"), Publications := "Experimental"] %>%
  .[Date >= as.IDate("2012-01-01"), Publications := "Analyst"] %>%
  .[, Publications := ifelse(str_detect(title, "NXF1"), "Both", Publications)] %>%
  .[]

pubs_smooth %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Some of that information is not necessary but I kept it anyway to show how it looks.

And a similar join was done for some key outreach dates that I also want to highlight in the final plot.

```{r adjust-outreach-dates}
## same for outreach activities
outreach <- antonio[Role == "Outreach" & Timpepoint == "Start"]

outreach_smooth <- smooth_df[outreach, roll = "nearest", on = "Date"] %>%
  .[, new_date := as.IDate(x)] %>%
  .[, Date:= NULL] %>%
  setnames("new_date", "Date") %>% 
  .[, c("Date", "y", "Type")] %>%
  .[]
```


## Annotate with degrees

I could have used point with different color/shape to highlight my academic degrees, but these belong to different category of events than publications or other more technical milestones / achievements, and it wold add too much information to the lines anyway. As an alternative I decided to use arrows and text to point out when those degrees where obtained. 

Again there is nothing magic or novel about this, in fact I took inspiration from [Cedric Scherer](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/top/dataviz/), except that need for trial and error to get the positions correct. The positions of the arrows were put on a `tibble` to make it easier to plot later on:

```{r add-highlights}
#
# plot annotations - academic points of interest
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
arrows <- tibble(
    x1 = c(as.IDate("2000-09-01"), as.IDate("2004-12-01"), as.IDate("2010-09-01")),
    x2 = c(as.IDate("2001-09-01"), as.IDate("2005-05-01"), as.IDate("2009-08-01")),
    y1 = c(0.08, 0.15, 0.35),
    y2 = c(0.13, 0.20, 0.40)
  )
arrows
```

Remember that in the plots show in the X-window, the arrows, text annotations, and icons where not in the correct locations. I kept saving the plots with the final dimensions to gauge that. Saving as pdf gave me the best results vs saving the plots as png. There is a commented out `ggsave` at the end which was used to save the plots with everything in it's right place.

This is the final output:

```{r final-plot}
p_complete <- p +
  geom_jitter(data = pubs_smooth %>% arrange(Publications), aes(x = Date, y = y, fill = Publications), size = 2, alpha = 0.8, stroke = 1, shape=21) +
  geom_point(data = outreach_smooth, aes(x = Date, y = y), fill = "#e37e00", size = 2, alpha = 0.7, stroke = 1, shape=23) +
  scale_colour_stata() +
  scale_fill_stata() +
  guides(
    fill = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)
  ) +
  labs(
    fill = "Publications:"
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text", x = as.IDate("1999-09-01"), y = 0.08, color = "gray20", lineheight = .9, 
    label = "BSc", size = 4, family = "Annie Use Your Telescope") + 
  annotate(
    "text", x = as.IDate("2004-11-01"), y = 0.12, color = "gray20", lineheight = .9, 
    label = "MSc", size = 4, family = "Annie Use Your Telescope") + 
  annotate(
    "text", x = as.IDate("2010-10-01"), y = 0.3, color = "gray20", lineheight = .9, 
    label = "PhD", size = 4, family = "Annie Use Your Telescope") + 
  geom_curve(
    data = arrows, aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.07, "inch")), size = 0.4,
    color = "gray20", curvature = 0.3
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.direction = "horizontal",
    legend.position = c(1, 0.05),
    legend.justification = c(1, 0))

p_save <- add_img(p_complete)
ggsave("../assets/img/timeline_complete.png", p_save, dpi = 300, width = 10, height = 6, units = "cm")

```
![timeline complete](../assets/img/timeline_complete.png?w=300)

What is the information depicted:

- icons depicting a start as a bench scientist and the current status as a data analyst
- a line showing a smooth upward trajectory towards data science, but
- data science only took over bench work (red line) at some point after my PhD 
- milestones (papers) are also depicted as round points, and in keeping with my trajectory there some in which I contributed only lab work, others with data analysis.
- the milestones with the diamond shape are to be described in the presentation (blog, R package maintainer). 

I hope you can appreciate that this plot contains a lot of information, but doesn't feel cluttered, that is, a decent amount of blank space. Also, this is not meant to be a self-contained, self-explanatory piece of data visualization - I will be guiding the audience through the pieces of information and revealing them only when needed.


## Getting there

Well, nearly final. There are still a couple of modifications to be done for the presentation:

1. No legend because I wanted to talk about the milestones during the presentation without giving way too early what the points meant;
2. Indication of the places of work is still missing. 

The latter is crucial to the presentation because I will be following each plot with an highlighted place of work with the my role there and task there. So in effect highlighting the plots in a stepwise manner is critical for having breaks and setting the tone for each part of the presentation.

Removing the legend fairly simple (once you know who to do it and I always google it).

```{r no-legend}

## no legend
p_no_leg <- p_complete +
  guides(
    fill = "none"
  )
p_save <- add_img(p_no_leg)
ggsave("../assets/img/timeline_no_legend.png", p_save, dpi = 300, width = 10, height = 6, units = "cm")
```

![timeline complete](../assets/img/timeline_no_legend.png?w=300)

To show how I moved around I made used of `geom_annotation` and shaded boxes to highlight each job, one at the time. Each one of these was then shown as bridge between parts of the talk.

For simplicity I am plotting only one here:  

```{r country-slides}
## add countries

p_no_leg <- p_complete +
  guides(
    fill = "none"
  )
add_img(p_no_leg)
# ggsave("timeline_no_legend.pdf", dpi = 600, width = 10, height = 6, units = "cm")

p_pt <- p_no_leg +
  annotate("rect",
    xmin = min(antonio$Date), xmax = as.Date("2006-02-01"), 
    ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,  fill = "#d9e6eb", alpha=0.35)
p_save <- add_img(p_pt)

ggsave("../assets/img/timeline_no_legend.pt.png", p_save, dpi = 600, width = 10, height = 6, units = "cm")

```

![timeline complete](../assets/img/timeline_no_legend.pt.png?w=300)

## Final word

And that was it. It me quite some time to get it done, including testing packages, but in the end I was quite happy the result. It was a lot of work, but I wanted to impress and I did.


## Footnotes

[^1]: Before any presentation I always think about who my audience will be and what is the goal. Only then do I start sketching the slides with pen and paper to organize the ideas into slides. One key message per slide.

[^2]: For example https://github.com/laresbernardo/lares and https://github.com/daattali/timevis.

[^3]: It's fine to use the publication record, but someone career should not be just about that. There's also teaching, mentoring, outreach, software, etc, which I am not sure it's always taken into account. Not that it affects me because I am not looking to climb the academic ladder.

[^4]: The slide-deck is not available, but if a few people show interest I could make put it online.
