## Issue

I use the Institutes's server for which I am not an administrator. Recently I noticed that the Bioconductor installed in our Debian server was two version out of date, and so I decided to install the newer version of `R` and upgrade the packages.


## Save installed packages 

Firstly I saved the list of packages previously installed so that these could be easily re-installed:

```R
saveInstalledPkgs <- function(out_file){
    pkgs <- rownames(installed.packages())
    save(pkgs, file=out_file)
}
version <- getRversion()
saveInstalledPkgs(
    paste(
        "~/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/installed_packages_",
        version,
        '.Rdata',
        sep='')
        )
```


## Compile R from source

The goal is to install it in a shared folder so that:

1. members of our group - biologists with little knowledge of the command line -get access that to the same R installation with which they can replicate my analysis.
2. package versions are the ones needed for our group's analysis without polluting the system-wide installation. 

Ultimately without `sudo` powers R needs to be installed from source and since there is no good equivalent to the excellent `python virtual env` it can be an involved process. This bit of could should have been all that was needed:

```bash
BIN=/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/
cd ${BIN}
wget http://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-3.3.2.tar.gz
tar xvf R-3.3.2.tar.gz
cd R-3.3.2
./configure --prefix=/home/adomingu/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.3.2 --enable-R-shlib
make && make install
```

and it as indeed worked in the past for an older version of R. However, for `R version 3.3.2` `make && install` threw an error in my general direction:

> checking if libcurl is version 7 and >= 7.28.0... no
> configure: error: libcurl >= 7.28.0 library and headers are required with support for https

Which sucks.

[everytime a tool needs to be compiled I die a little inside]


### Compile curl

So I needed to compile the `curl` as well. Following this [tutorial](http://pj.freefaculty.org/blog/?p=315), #11:

```bash
BIN=/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin
cd $BIN
wget --no-check-certificate https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.51.0.tar.gz &&
tar xzvf curl-7.51.0.tar.gz  &&
cd curl-7.51.0  &&
./configure --prefix=$BIN/curl &&
make -j3  &&
make install 

# make R (or better gcc) aware of the new libcurl (first two for building, the last two for the ./configure step)
LIBCURL_LOCAL_DIR="$BIN/curl"
export PATH=$LIBCURL_LOCAL_DIR/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBCURL_LOCAL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBCURL_CFLAGS=-I$LIBCURL_LOCAL_DIR/include
export LIBCURL_LIBS=-L$LIBCURL_LOCAL_DIR/lib

cd $BIN/
tar xvf R-3.3.2.tar.gz
mv R-3.3.2/ R/
cd $BIN/R/R-3.3.2
## configure R for usage in dependency tree (adjust if needed)
./configure --prefix=/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.3.2 --with-x --with-blas --with-lapack --with-cairo --enable-static --enable-R-static-lib --enable-R-shlib --with-libpng --with-jpeglib --with-libtiff --with-ICU --with-tcl-config=/usr/lib/tclConfig.sh --with-tk-config=/usr/lib/tkConfig.sh --with-tcltk &&
make && make install
cd ..
chmod -R ug+rw R-3.3.2
```

As it is easy to see there were a lot options needed for the compiling to work, but it did work in the end.


## Install libraries

Install libraries in a specific folder, [instructions](https://www.stat.osu.edu/computer-support/mathstatistics-packages/installing-r-libraries-locally-your-home-directory). Remember that for each R version there will be a correspondent libraries folder:

```bash
TOOL_DEPENDENCIES="/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin"
mkdir ${TOOL_DEPENDENCIES}/R/R-3.3.2_LIBS
export PATH=${TOOL_DEPENDENCIES}/R/R-3.3.2/bin:$PATH
export R_LIBS=${TOOL_DEPENDENCIES}/R-R/3.3.2_LIBS
```

This lines were also added to the `.bashrc`:

```bash
## without the folowing line R will not be able to connect to the internet - custom installation
export PATH=/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/curl/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/curl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export R_LIBS=/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.3.2_LIBS
```

Then from `${TOOL_DEPENDENCIES}/R/R-3.3.2/bin/R` to install libraries:


```r
## old
#.libPaths()
#[1] "/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.2.2_LIBS"           
#[2] "/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.3.2/lib64/R/library"

shared_libs="/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.3.2_LIBS"
.libPaths(shared_libs)
shared_libs
# http://stackoverflow.com/a/4090208/1274242
load('~/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/installed_packages_3.3.2.Rdata')
new_pkgs <- pkgs[!(pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_pkgs) > 0) { install.packages(new_pkgs)}

new_pkgs <- pkgs[!(pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(new_pkgs)

source("http://bioconductor.org/workflows.R")
workflowInstall("rnaseqGene")
devtools::install_github("genomicsclass/ERBS")
```

Confer access to other users with `chmod -R ug+rw /fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin`.


### Bioconductor

Bioconductor packages can also be installed like the above, but through biocLite:

```r
shared_libs="/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.3.2_LIBS"
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Gviz", lib=shared_libs)

library(Gviz)
```

There were some issues installing a package dependency, `ggally`, solved with:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("ggobi/ggally")
```

And changing the library path is also helpful:

```r
shared_libs="/fsimb/groups/imb-kettinggr/common_bin/R/R-3.3.2_LIBS"
.libPaths(c(.libPaths(), shared_libs))
```

I hope this helps someone else in my situation.
