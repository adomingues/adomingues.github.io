_Updated on 11.01.2015 to correct spelling mistakes, grammar, and add new information about the speakers._

My new laptop has arrived, and after testing it for a couple of days, I feel that I can post my own impressions of the Dell XPS13 (9333).

Those in the Linux world may have heard of it by the code name _sputnik_. Originally this model was developed by Dell, with an eye on developers, and thus it is one of the very few laptops to be offered with Linux Ubuntu pre-installed.  As a bioinformatician, or genomics data analyst as I call myself (not very catchy), working on a *nix machine is a must. Even though I worked in OSX for a while, it never really impressed me, so when deciding on a laptop for my new job, I had three things on my wish-list:

1. Linux compatibility, to run all the tools I need;
2. 
light, to carry home and show results to colleagues;
3. 
somewhat powerful, to test scripts and be "future-proof";

## Some specs

With the above in mind, I got the XP13 with the following specs:

Intel(r) Core(tm) i7-4510U  (4M Cache, up to 3.1 GHz)  
8 GB Dual-Channel DDR3 with 1.600 MHz  
Solid-State-hardrive (SSD) with 512 GB  
Intel HD Grafics 4400  
1.37 kg

Unfortunately the model with pre-installed Ubuntu was not available in Germany, apparently they are out of stock, so mine came with Windows 8 pre-installed. Obviously the 1st thing I did to replace Windows with a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 from a liveUSB. Everything pretty much worked out of the box, which is the new unremarkable normal for modern Linux distros, specially those based on Ubuntu. Of note, the touchscreen  (which I do not care about) works, at least selecting and scrolling. Connecting the wifi was also a doodle. It took me almost more time to disable the annoying Windows features to allow the Linux installation than it did to make the install itself. In less than 1 hour I had the computer ready to work.

## Review

###Design  
Oh boy does it look good! Nice aluminium touch, very elegant. I could compare it to a Macbook Air and it is noticeable smaller, both in width and depth, and prettier for my eyes.

###Screen

Excellent resolution, bright colours - amazing.  The less fun part is that at 1920x1080 fonts and icons are rather small, but nothing that can't be fixed.

**coil whine**

This refers to a wizz sound coming from the keyboard area. In my case it is barely noticeable, and turning of the keyboard back-lighting stops it. I don't care about this light so it works for me. Most of the time the noise is barely audible though.

###Temperature

This is something of a problem with Linux laptops. I have installed laptop-mode-tools and, as we speak, it is running at 45-55Âºc, with Firefox, Thunderbird, Sublime text, and terminal open. So not an issue for me.

**Keyboard and mousepad**  
The keyboard is responsive, without being too edgy. The mouse pad is rather large, and does not have physically separated buttons, so it I am still adjusting and trying to the right-click. Both feel somewhat roughed, at least in comparison to my Toshiba T230, which is neither a good or bad thing, it just offers more resistance and feedback to the touch. It should be noted that the page-up and -down do not have dedicated buttons, nor does the end/start (so useful to navigate lines of code). However, the use of `fn + arrows` solves the problem.

###Sound  
Good enough. This is a laptop, not a sound system. Scracth that, after some more testing, the sound is loud and clear. Very decent (for a laptop of course).

**battery life**  
It looks like I can squeeze 5 hours out of it easily, but it is too early to tell.

###Dock  
I also got a Dell dock with it, because let's face it, 2 USB entries is just low, and I am connected to a server most of the time and prefer to do it over an ethernet connection for stability. From what I tested so far, the sound and display entries of the dock do not work. On the other hand, the USB and the ethernet work.

## Conclusion

All in all I am very happy with my new shinny Ubuntu ultrabook. And I stress ultra because coming from a 4 year old laptop (still working well) with less than 2 kg, I cannot entertain the thought of not having a light laptop and the XPS13 is the perfect upgrade to my Toshiba T230.
