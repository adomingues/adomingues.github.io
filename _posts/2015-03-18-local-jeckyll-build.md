It took me while from moving my blog from [wordpress](https://movingtothedarkside.wordpress.com/) to [github pages](http://adomingues.github.io/) and writing a new post. Such a long time that I forgot that to build the site locally I need to use `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` instead of `jekyll serve --watch`. 

I won't forget now.
