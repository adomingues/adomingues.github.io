# About

At some point during my postdoc I decided that I wanted to have control over analysis of the data generated by hight-throughput experiments. Mistakes and and will always happen, but I would rather be able to detect and fix them myself. So I started learning scripting, and suddenly the time spent on the computer analysing became longer and, despite all the compiling frustrations, more enjoyable. The pipette lost. Long live the keyboard. This blog is a collection of tips, hints, and ramblings that detailed my journey from qPCR and cell culture to R scripting and bedtools - sometimes a combination of both. A journey to the dark side from the perspective of a bench biologist. It is intended primarily as personal notes for future reference, so I might even put a few cooking recipes (mostly quasi-paleo).
